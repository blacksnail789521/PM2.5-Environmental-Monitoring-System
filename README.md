* Created an interactive website that can self-monitor PM2.5 sensors in real time (HTML, JavaScript, CSS)
* Displayed the basic readings of each sensor and used color coding to display the indicator level (D3.js, leaflet.js)
*	Created profiles (average, extremum, motif) for each sensor to perform subsequent analysis more easily (e.g., path detection and change point detection) (Python, plotly.js)
