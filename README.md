Created an interactive website that can self-monitor PM2.5 sensors in real time (HTML, JavaScript, CSS)

Displayed the basic readings of each sensor and used color coding to display the indicator level (D3.js, leaflet.js)

Created profiles (average, extremum, motif) for each sensor to perform subsequent analysis more easily (e.g., path detection and change point detection) (Python, plotly.js)
