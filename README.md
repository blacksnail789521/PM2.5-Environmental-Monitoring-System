•	Created an interactive website that can self-monitor PM2.5 sensors in real time (coding with HTML, JavaScript, CSS).<br />
•	Displayed the basic readings of each sensor and used color to directly display the indicator level (coding with D3.js, leaflet.js).<br />
•	Created the profile (average, extremum, motif) for each sensor to make the subsequent analysis (such as path detection and change point detection) easier (coding with Python, plotly.js).
